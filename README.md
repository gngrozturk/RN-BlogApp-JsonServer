# RN-BlogApp-JsonServer

This is a server of my [RN-BlogApp](https://github.com/gngrozturk/RN-BlogApp) project.

## Getting Started

Run:
```bash
npm run db
```
to run server

then run:
```bash
npm run tunnel
```
to make this server available to outside world.

If you do this successfully, you will see a console like this:

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/gngrozturk/RN-BlogApp-JsonServer/blob/master/ss.png" width="300" />
Copy the marked url from your console 

## Almost Done
If you check the "src/api/jsonServer.js" directory you will see a "baseURL". Paste that URL you just copied here as a value of baseURL.
